  <h1>Useful Modules</h1>
  <hr>

  <p> If you want to develop an &quot;Automated plant watering system&quot;. Well, you&apos;re in luck&excl; As today I&apos;m going to share with you some of modules I had used with <strong>Arduino</strong> microcontroller.<p>
  <p> Moving forward, following are the modules that I had used for <strong>prototype development:</strong>.</p>
  <ol class="Main">
      <li>433 MHz Transmitter</li>
      <li>Humidity Sensor</li>
      <li>Motor Drivers L298N</li>
  </ol>
 
  <h2>433 MHz Transmitter</h2>
  <p>In general, the transmitter is an electronic device that produce radio-waves with assist with the antenna. The antenna actually receives the radio-frequency alternating current which originally generated<br>
  by the transmitter. Transmitter is needed in order to produce communication between many electronic devices wirelessly, such as: phones, radars, wireless network and etc.</p>

  <h2>Humidity Sensor</h2>
  <p1>The soil moisture sensor is defined as an electrical resistance, it is used to sense the device like &apos;WATERMARK&apos; soil moisture sensor and it produces different reading signals, which can be represented by the<br>
  voltage outputs equivalent with the amount of soil water pressure and rate of humid in the soil. 
  </p1>
  <p>A soil moisture sensor measures the water content in soil. According to the readings of the sensor, the rate of water can be detected either wet or dry, while the sensor senses the soil, and if the state of water is dry <br>
  and if the output readings of the sensor are indicating this state of water, the sensor sends signal through the transmitter to the Arduino which is connected to water pump, then the pump starts working, in order to produce <br>
  the required rate of water to the soil.</p>
  <p>Soil moisture probe consists of many soil moisture sub sensors. Soil moisture sensor usually used have the features as described below:</p>
  <ul class="Sub-Main1">
     <li>Neutron moisture meter to moistures the rate water as the water consists of neutron moderator.</li>
     <li>Soil resistivity which can be used in order to measure the soil moisture content. This type of simple soil sensor is made of two conductors. The resistance can be measured using voltage divider and an analog pin. Though<br> 
     itâ€™s built very simple, the resistive sensors are not reliable for long time, because the bare conductors get oxidized over time.</li>
     <li>Frequency domain sensor, such as a capacitive sensor, this type of sensors is made of two conductors, but not bare. The two conductors together with the soil are considered as a dielectric material.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Motor Driver Module L298N</h2>
  <p>A direct current motor is the most famous type of motor. DC motors usually have only two leads, one positive and the other is negative. The motor starts rotating while the two leads connected to enough supply voltage in the<br>
  same direction, but if the leads are connected to the supply voltage in the opposite pins, the motor will rotate in the opposite direction. </p>
  <p>The L298 motor is a useful dual-motor driver IC because it handles more current and more voltage. It consists of many feature which are as follows:</p>
  <ul class="Sub-Main2">
     <li>It can operate 6 to 26 V and 4 A total drive current.</li>
     <li>Accessible 5V regulated voltage.</li>
     <li>Motor direction indicator LEDs.</li>
     <li>EMF protection diodes Small 40mm (1.527&apos;&apos;) square footprint.</li>
  </ul>
